Presentation

### January 9-19, 2018

The project finally works with stereo sound input as intended, main goals were reached, minor goals were lost or were superseded by other goals in favour of practicality.

Project slides are uploaded for presentation:

### January 1, 2018 

New Year, time of reflections and beginnings

### December 22, 2017

Today I demonstrated my project and uploaded my progress report which summarizes my progress so far.

### December 15, 2017

I submitted my 30 second video with a functional demo of my sound sensor. I'm happy with the result in general as the signal is being transmitted and the code reads the volume dynamically.

### Thoughts of the day - December 15, 2017

So far I have used a blackboard/direct wiring connection instead of the PCB but I plan to use the PCB in future projects. I should start on fritzing and draw up schematics.

### December 8, 2017

I finished and submitted my 30 second Video Script as well as booted and set up my own Raspberry PI for my sensor. I got the LED blinking, the test program showed the LED blink in different colours (Red and Yellow)

Our group placard is submitted today as well

### December 1, 2017

I soldered my PCB to completion, with a FULLY succesful test on connectivity and attempted to run the raspberry PI but failed due to failure of connection to PC. Neither Putty or remote desktop connection worked. I attempted different raspberry Pis but the instructions did not work. Troubleshooting was also not succesful.

### December 1, 2017 Thoughts of the day

I must try to get my raspberry PI running properly for next class

### November 24, 2017

Strike finally ended after 5 weeks.
During this time I got my final parts, the two sound modules, and an extra sound module just in case.

I also used fritzing to change the PCB to reflect an abbreviated version of my name on it and sent a request to the parts crib to get it produced

### November 24, 2017 Thoughts of the day

Next up I have to start soldering the PCB parts as soon as possible.

Luckily I feel like I have a good reference resource to look at:

### October 16, 2017

Strike started.

### October 13, 2017

I got my first part, the Raspberry Pi and ordered two sound sensors which didn't arrive yet.

### September 29, 2017 Link of the day

http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Sound-detector-circuit.php - a good link relating to the craft of building a sound sensor, for my research

### September 29, 2017 Thoughts of the day

I got my sound detection hardware more or less figured out by buying two sound modules, how do I apply it now with Erick and Heakeme's DMX? 
One good idea I got today was to use led's to show the user when sound levels are at a critical level, perhaps I use one sound module for noise appliance and the other for commands for the DMX system? Still, I'm not too sure how to use them in tandem.

Uploaded Budget Proposal

### September 22, 2017 Questions/Problems of the day

How can I connect my project to Erick and Heakeme's DMX projects and Crystal Fountains?
What specifics will my project have, perhaps use it as a sound control detector for the Crystal Fountains?
(e.g. the fountains functions will work differently depending on command/noise received)

Lastly, should I buy parts or borrow them?

### September 22, 2017

Uploaded Gantt Chart on GitHub as well as handed in physically 
Uploaded Proposal that was handed in a week ago
Finally, started this blog
