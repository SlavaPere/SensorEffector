### September 8, 2017

Started Noise Detector/Sound Level Project
 
### September 22, 2017

Uploaded Gantt Chart on GitHub as well as handed in physically 
Uploaded Proposal that was handed in a week ago
Finally, started this blog

### September 22, 2017 Questions/Problems of the day

How can I connect my project to Erick and Heakeme's DMX projects and Crystal Fountains?
What specifics will my project have, perhaps use it as a sound control detector for the Crystal Fountains?
(e.g. the fountains functions will work differently depending on command/noise received)

Lastly, should I buy parts or borrow them?

### September 29, 2017 Thoughts of the day

I got my sound detection hardware more or less figured out by buying two sound modules, how do I apply it now with Erick and Heakeme's DMX? One good idea I got today was to use led's to show the user when sound levels are at a critical level, perhaps I use one sound module for noise appliance and the other for commands for the DMX system? Still, I'm not too sure how to use them in tandem.

### September 29, 2017 Link of the day

http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Sound-detector-circuit.php - a good link relating to the craft of building a sound sensor, for my research

### October 13, 2017

I got my first part, the Raspberry Pi and ordered two sound sensors which didn't arrive yet.
